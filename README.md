## Local development

```
npm run start
```

This site is using @azure/static-web-apps-cli for local development which
at the time of writing does not support Node v20. To use the start script
in package.json, <= Node v18 needs to be installed.  
See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli/issues/756) for more information.
